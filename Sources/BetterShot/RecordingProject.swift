//  Per-project bookkeeping that lives beside the capture manifest: the name
//  shown in the Projects browser, when the project was last committed with
//  ⌘S, and when it was last opened (which orders the Recordings menu).
//  Every field is optional so a package recorded before projects existed -
//  or one whose sidecar was lost - still resolves to sensible defaults.
