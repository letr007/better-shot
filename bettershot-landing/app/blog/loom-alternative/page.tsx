                Loom made async video a habit. But $18 per seat per month, a five-minute cap on the
                free plan, and every recording routed through someone else&apos;s servers is a lot to
                accept for something that started as a screen recording. Here is what a free, open

              <P>
                Loom turned screen recording into a communication pattern. Hit record, talk through
                the problem, share a link, and move on. The value was never the recording itself; it
                was the instant link, the transcript, the viewer analytics, and the comments below
                the video. For teams that live in Loom links the way others live in Slack threads,
                the social layer around each recording is real.
              </P>
              <P>
                On the capture side, Loom records your screen and camera, generates a transcript,
                and hosts the video on its own CDN. Setup is minimal: install, record, share.
              </P>

              <P>
                The free Starter plan caps recordings at five minutes per video and 25 videos per
                member. That limit hits mid-demo, which is worse than not having a free tier at all.
                Business costs $18 per seat per month ($12.50 billed yearly), and every seat is
                billed whether they record that month or not.
              </P>

              <P>
                Better Shot is a native macOS app (Swift, AppKit) that handles capture, recording,
                editing, and sharing in one window. You pick a display, a window, or an area from a
                floating source picker, toggle mic and system audio, set a start delay, and record.
              </P>
              <List
                items={[
                  "Display, window, or region capture with a floating source picker",
                  "Face cam bubble you drag anywhere on screen, composited live during capture",
                  "Microphone and system audio on separate tracks (mic requires macOS 15)",
                  "24, 30, or 60 fps, multi-display aware",
                  "Pause and resume, restart without leaving the control bar",
                  "Fragmented MP4: every frame is committed as it arrives, so a crash mid-recording leaves a playable file",
                ]}
              />

              <H2 id="cursor-auto-zoom">Cursor auto-zoom</H2>
              <P>
                This is the feature that makes Better Shot recordings look different from Loom. The
                pointer is sampled at 30 Hz during capture. Every click becomes a smooth zoom cue,
                and those cues are processed through a spring-damped viewport timeline before being
                baked into the export. A 4K display stays readable inside a 480p video player
                without you keyframing anything.
              </P>
              <P>
                The zoom cues are visible on the timeline after recording. You can retime, rescale,
                or delete any of them before export. The result is a walkthrough that follows your
                mouse the way a cameraman follows the action, automatically.
              </P>

              <H2 id="editing">A real timeline editor</H2>
              <P>
                Loom gives you a trim slider. Better Shot gives you a multi-clip timeline. The
                difference matters the moment a recording has a mistake in the middle, a slow section
                that needs speeding up, or a stretch of dead air at the start.
              </P>
              <List
                items={[
                  "Split at the playhead, drag an edge to trim, delete what you do not want",
                  "Per-clip speed from 0.25x to 4x, applied to video and audio together",
                  "Crop with corner and edge handles and a rule-of-thirds grid",

              />

              <H2 id="captions">On-device captions</H2>
              <P>
                Captions in Better Shot are a timeline lane, not a post-processing step. They run on
                Apple&apos;s speech recognition framework, entirely on device. Your audio never touches
                a server. The captions appear on the timeline alongside your zoom cues, keystrokes,
                and masks, and you can retime or edit any of them before export.
              </P>
              <P>
                Loom generates transcripts server-side after upload. Better Shot generates them
                locally before you share. The tradeoff: Loom&apos;s server-side transcription handles
                more languages; Better Shot&apos;s on-device approach handles the languages Apple
                supports and keeps the audio private.
              </P>

              <H2 id="sharing">Share links you own</H2>
              <P>
                This is the fundamental difference between Loom and Better Shot. Loom hosts your
                recording on its servers and hands you a loom.com link. Better Shot uploads the
                edited recording directly from the app to <Strong>your own Cloudflare R2
                bucket</Strong> over a signed request (SigV4), then copies the public link.
              </P>
              <List
                items={[
                  "No proxy, no vendor in the middle, no per-seat pricing on the link",
                  "No five-minute cap, no video quota, no viewer limit",
                  "Your R2 keys live in the macOS Keychain, never on a remote server",
                  "Delete a video by deleting the object from R2. Gone from the edge, verifiably.",
                  "R2 storage costs are typically cents per month for screen recordings",
                ]}
              />
              <P>
                The tradeoff: you need to set up a Cloudflare R2 bucket and enter the keys in Better
                Shot&apos;s settings. That takes about five minutes. If you want hosted sharing with zero
                setup, Loom is still the faster path.
              </P>

              <H2 id="performance">Native macOS performance</H2>
              <P>
                Loom&apos;s desktop app is built on Electron. Better Shot is built with Swift and AppKit.
                The difference shows up in three places: CPU usage during recording, battery drain,
                and memory consumption. A native app that does not bundle a browser to render its UI
                starts lighter and stays lighter through a long recording session.
              </P>
              <P>
                Better Shot writes fragmented MP4, which means every frame is committed to disk as it
                arrives. If the app crashes, if the machine loses power, or if you force-quit
                mid-recording, the file is playable up to the last written frame. Loom does not offer
                this guarantee.
              </P>

              <P>
                Prices are as published in August 2026. R2 storage for share links is billed by
                Cloudflare at usage rates and is typically cents per month for screen recordings.

                Existing Loom recordings stay on Loom. Better Shot does not import from Loom, and
                Loom does not offer bulk export. Going forward, new recordings live on your machine
                and (optionally) your R2 bucket.

                <Faq q="Is Better Shot really free?">
                  Yes. BSD 3 Clause licensed open source with no paid tier planned. The cost you carry
                  is that support is GitHub issues, not a support desk.
                </Faq>
                <Faq q="Do I need a Cloudflare R2 bucket?">
                  Only for share links. Without R2, everything else works: capture, record, edit,
                  export. You share files the way you already do.
                </Faq>
                <Faq q="Does it work on Apple Silicon and Intel?">
                  Yes. Separate DMGs for Apple Silicon and Intel. Also available via Homebrew.
                </Faq>
                <Faq q="What about viewer analytics and comments?">
                  Better Shot does not have them. If your team depends on who-watched-what data and
                  threaded comments on every video, Loom earns its price for that use case.
                </Faq>
                <Faq q="Can I use it for client work?">
                  Yes. The BSD 3 Clause license permits commercial use, modification, and
                  redistribution.
                </Faq>
                <Faq q="Does it put a watermark on recordings?">
                  No. There is no watermark at any resolution or length.
