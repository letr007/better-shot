                If you take screenshots for work, record walkthroughs for teammates, and trim those
                recordings before sending them, you are probably paying three companies for one job.
                Here is what each of those tools actually does, and where a free, open source macOS

              <P>
                It happens gradually. macOS ships with <Code>⌘⇧4</Code>, which is fine until you need
                an arrow on the screenshot. So you buy <Strong>CleanShot X</Strong>. Then a teammate
                asks for a walkthrough instead of a paragraph, so you sign up for{" "}
                <Strong>Loom</Strong>. Then a recording runs long and needs a cut in the middle, so
                you open <Strong>CapCut</Strong>. Three apps, three accounts, and two recurring
                charges to explain what is on your screen.
              </P>
              <P>
                Each of those tools is good at what it was built for. The question is whether you
                need all three, and whether the work has to leave your machine at all.
              </P>

              <H2 id="what-each-tool-does">What each tool is actually for</H2>
              <P>
                <Strong>CleanShot X</Strong> is a screenshot tool with an excellent capture flow:
                scrolling capture, annotation, pinned overlays, and a quick access overlay after
                every shot. As of August 2026 it is $29 one time for a license with a year of
                updates, with CleanShot Cloud at $8/month if you want hosted links.
              </P>
              <P>
                <Strong>Loom</Strong> is an async video messaging product. The recording is the small
                part; the value is hosting, instant links, transcripts, viewer analytics, and
                comments. The free Starter plan caps you at 25 videos per member and five minutes per
                recording. Business runs $18 per seat per month.

                <Strong>CapCut</Strong> is a general video editor built for social content: multi
                track timelines, music, captions, transitions, and an AI toolkit. CapCut Pro is
                $19.99/month, and pricing varies by region and device.

              <P>
                <Strong>Better Shot</Strong> is a native macOS app that covers the overlap between
                them: capture, annotate, record with cursor auto zoom, trim, beautify, export, and
                optionally share from storage you own. It is free, BSD 3 Clause licensed, and does
                not have an account system.

              <H2 id="cleanshot-x-alternative">As a CleanShot X alternative</H2>
              <P>
                This is the closest overlap, and the easiest switch. Better Shot binds the same
                muscle memory: <Code>⌘⇧4</Code> for a region, <Code>⌘⇧3</Code> for the screen,{" "}
                <Code>⌘⇧2</Code> for the capture and recording bar. After every capture a floating preview appears, and
                you can drag it straight into Figma, Slack, or Finder without saving a file first.
              </P>

                items={[
                  "Annotation tools with single-key shortcuts: arrows, rectangles, circles, freehand, text with font control, numbered badges, blur, and spotlight",

                  "A system wide color picker on ⌘⇧C",

              <P>
                The notable gap is <Strong>scrolling capture</Strong>. CleanShot X stitches a long
                page into one image; Better Shot does not do that yet. If scrolling capture is
                central to your work, that alone may keep you on CleanShot X.
              </P>

              <H2 id="loom-alternative">As a Loom alternative for Mac</H2>
              <P>
                Recording is where Better Shot changed the most in v4. You pick a display, a window,
                or an area from a floating source picker, toggle microphone and system audio, set a
                start delay, and record. The bar you set up in is the bar you stop in.
              </P>
              <P>
                The feature that makes recordings watchable is <Strong>cursor auto zoom</Strong>.
                Pointer position is sampled at 30 Hz during capture, clicks become zoom cues, and
                those cues are smoothed through a spring-damped viewport timeline and baked into the
                export. A 4K screen stays readable inside a small video player, without you manually
                keyframing anything. Every cue can still be retimed, rescaled, or deleted before
                export.
              </P>
              <List
                items={[
                  "Face cam bubble you can drag anywhere, captured as part of the recording rather than composited after",
                  "Microphone recorded as its own audio track, separate from system audio (requires macOS 15)",

              />
              <P>
                Sharing works differently, and that difference is the whole point. Loom hosts your
                video and hands you a link. Better Shot uploads the edited recording directly from
                the app to <Strong>your own Cloudflare R2 bucket</Strong> over a signed request, then
                copies the public link. No proxy, no vendor in the middle, no per-seat pricing, no
                five-minute cap, and no video quota. Your R2 keys live in the macOS Keychain.
              </P>
              <P>
                What you give up: viewer analytics, comment threads, automatic transcripts, and the
                social layer around a Loom link. If those are how your team works, Loom earns its
                price.
              </P>

              <P>
                Most people open CapCut on a screen recording for four reasons: cut the dead air at
                the start, split out a mistake in the middle, speed up a slow section, and make the
                result look presentable. All four are in Better Shot&apos;s video editor.
              </P>

              />
              <P>
                What CapCut still does better: multi track editing, music and sound effects, auto
                captions, transitions, keyframed effects, and its AI toolkit. Better Shot is a screen
                recording editor, not a general-purpose video editor. If you are producing content
                for an audience rather than a colleague, keep CapCut.

              <P>
                Screenshots and screen recordings are unusually sensitive. They contain client
                dashboards, internal tools, half written messages, unreleased features, and whatever
                else was open behind the window you meant to capture. Uploading all of that to a
                vendor just to generate a link is a habit worth questioning.
              </P>
              <P>
                Better Shot is local first by construction: capture, edit, and export never touch the
                network. There is no account, no telemetry, and no analytics in the app. Share links
                are optional and land in a bucket you control, which means you can also delete them
                properly. You can verify all of that, because the{" "}
                <A href="https://github.com/KartikLabhshetwar/better-shot">source is public</A>.

                If you are coming from CleanShot X, keep it installed for a week and use whichever
                opens first. Most people stop reaching for the paid one within a few days, except for
                scrolling capture.

                <Faq q="Is there a catch to it being free?">
                  No. It is BSD 3 Clause licensed open source, maintained in public, with no paid
                  tier planned. The cost you carry is that support is GitHub issues, not a support
                  desk.
                </Faq>
                <Faq q="Does it put a watermark on exports?">
                  No. There is no watermark at any resolution or length, because there are no tiers
                  to upsell you to.
                </Faq>
                <Faq q="Can I use it for client work?">
                  Yes. The BSD 3 Clause license permits commercial use, modification, and
                  redistribution.
                </Faq>
                <Faq q="Do I need Cloudflare R2 to use it?">
                  No. R2 is only needed for share links. Without it, everything else works and you
                  share files the way you already do.
