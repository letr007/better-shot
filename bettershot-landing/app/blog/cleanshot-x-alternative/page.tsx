                CleanShot X is the screenshot tool most Mac power users reach for first. For $29 you
                get scrolling capture, annotations, a quick-access overlay, and one of the most
                polished capture flows on the platform. But $29 is the starting point, not the whole
                price, and a free alternative now covers most of the same ground.

              <H2 id="what-cleanshot-x-does">What CleanShot X does well</H2>
              <P>
                CleanShot X is a dedicated screenshot and screen recording tool for macOS. It launched
                in 2019 and has built a reputation for speed, polish, and a capture flow that stays out
                of your way. The core license is $29 one-time with a year of updates. CleanShot Cloud,
                their hosting service for share links, adds $8 per month.
              </P>
              <P>
                Its standout features: scrolling capture that stitches long pages into a single image,
                a quick-access overlay after every shot, desktop icon hiding, annotation tools with a
                clean toolbar, and a well-designed preferences pane that lets you configure almost
                everything.
              </P>

              <H2 id="what-better-shot-does">What Better Shot does</H2>
              <P>
                Better Shot is a free, open source macOS app that covers screenshots, screen recording,
                video editing, and optional self-hosted sharing. It is BSD 3 Clause licensed, has no
                account system, no trial, and no paid tier. You can read every line of the{" "}
                <A href="https://github.com/KartikLabhshetwar/better-shot">source code</A>.
              </P>
              <P>
                For screenshots specifically, it matches the core CleanShot X workflow: capture a
                region, window, or full screen with a keyboard shortcut, see a floating preview, then
                edit, copy, pin, drag, or dismiss. On top of that, it adds a full screen recording
                suite with cursor auto-zoom, a multi-clip timeline editor, on-device captions, and
                share links on your own Cloudflare R2 bucket.

              <P>
                Both apps use the same muscle memory. <Code>Cmd+Shift+4</Code> for a region,{" "}
                <Code>Cmd+Shift+3</Code> for the screen, <Code>Cmd+Shift+2</Code> for Better Shot’s capture and recording bar.
                After every capture a floating preview appears in the corner. From that preview you
                can open the editor, copy the image, pin it above your work, or drag the file
                directly into another app.
              </P>
              <P>
                The capture quality is identical: both use the native macOS APIs, both capture at
                Retina resolution, and both let you save to the clipboard, desktop, or a custom
                folder.
              </P>
              <P>
                Better Shot also includes <Strong>OCR text extraction</Strong> with a dedicated
                shortcut (<Code>Cmd+Shift+O</Code>), built on Apple&apos;s Vision framework. And a
                system-wide <Strong>color picker</Strong> on <Code>Cmd+Shift+C</Code> that copies
                HEX, RGB, or HSL.
              </P>

              <H2 id="annotations">Annotation tools</H2>
              <P>
                Both apps let you draw on a screenshot before saving it. Better Shot has arrows,
                rectangles, circles, freehand drawing, text with font control, numbered step badges,
                blur, pixelate, and spotlight, each with a single-key shortcut.
              </P>
              <P>
                CleanShot X offers a similar set plus a few extras: a counter tool, a crop that
                preserves the shadow, and a wider range of arrow and line styles. If you spend most
                of your day annotating bug reports, CleanShot X has more specialized tools for that
                specific job.
              </P>
              <P>
                For the beautify workflow (padding, shadow, corner radius, background), both apps
                produce similar results. Better Shot supports solid colors, gradients, macOS
                wallpapers, or your own image as a background, with auto-apply so every capture comes
                out styled without opening the editor.
              </P>

              <H2 id="video-bonus">The feature CleanShot X does not have</H2>
              <P>
                This is where the comparison stops being apples to apples. Better Shot includes a
                full screen recording suite that CleanShot X does not match:
              </P>
              <List
                items={[
                  "Cursor auto-zoom: pointer sampled at 30 Hz, clicks become smooth zoom cues, a 4K screen stays readable in a small player",

              />
              <P>
                If you currently use CleanShot X for screenshots and Loom or another tool for screen
                recordings, Better Shot replaces both with one free app.

                CleanShot X pricing is as published in August 2026. The $29 license includes one year
                of updates; after that, a renewal is $19/year for continued updates. Cloud is billed
                monthly. Better Shot&apos;s R2 storage for share links is billed by Cloudflare at
                usage rates, typically a few cents per month for screen recordings.
              </P>

              <H2 id="privacy">Your screenshots, your machine</H2>
              <P>
                Screenshots contain sensitive information: client dashboards, unreleased features,
                internal tools, half-written messages. Better Shot is local-first by construction:
                capture, edit, and export never touch the network unless you explicitly share. There
                is no account, no telemetry, and no analytics in the app. Share links land in a
                bucket you control, which means you can also delete them properly.
              </P>
              <P>
                CleanShot X is also a local app, but CleanShot Cloud routes your screenshots through
                their servers. If you use Cloud for sharing, your screenshots are on someone
                else&apos;s infrastructure.
              </P>

              <P>
                Keep CleanShot X installed for a week and use whichever opens first. Most people stop
                reaching for the paid one within a few days. The exception is scrolling capture: if
                you rely on it daily, you will notice the gap.

              <div className="my-8 divide-y divide-zinc-200 rounded-2xl border border-zinc-200">
                <Faq q="Is there a catch to it being free?">
                  No. It is BSD 3 Clause licensed open source, maintained in public, with no paid tier
                  planned. The trade-off is that support is GitHub issues, not a support desk.
                </Faq>
                <Faq q="Does it put a watermark on screenshots or exports?">
                  No. There is no watermark at any resolution or file size, because there are no tiers
                  to upsell you to.
                </Faq>
                <Faq q="Can I use it for client work?">
                  Yes. The BSD 3 Clause license permits commercial use, modification, and
                  redistribution.
                </Faq>
                <Faq q="Does it support scrolling capture?">
                  Not yet. If scrolling capture is essential, keep CleanShot X for that. Everything
                  else works in Better Shot.
                </Faq>
                <Faq q="Does it record screen too?">
                  Yes. Cursor auto-zoom, face cam, on-device captions, multi-clip timeline editing,
                  and share links on your own R2 bucket. This is the main reason people switch from
                  CleanShot X: they get screenshots and screen recording in one free app.
                </Faq>
                <Faq q="What macOS version do I need?">
                  macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later. Microphone capture during recordings requires macOS 15
                  because that is where ScreenCaptureKit added it.
